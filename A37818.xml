         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALthough we Your Majeſties moſt humble and faithfull Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, have been very unhappy in many former Petitions and Supplications to Your Majeſty, wherein we have repreſented our moſt dutifull Affections, in adviſing and deſiring thoſe things which we held moſt neceſſary for the preſervation of Gods true Religion, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſafety and Honour, and the peace of the Kingdome; And with much ſorrow doe perceive, That Your Majeſty, incens'd by many falſe Calumnies and Slanders, doth continue to raiſe forces againſt us, and Your other peaceable and loyall Subjects, and to make great preparations for War, both in the Kingdom, and from beyond the Seas; and by Arms and violence to over-rule the Judgement and Advice of Your great Councell, and by force to determine the Queſtions there depending, concerning the Government and Liberty of the Kingdome yet ſuch is our earneſt deſire of diſcharging our duty to Your Majeſty and the Kingdome, to preſerve the peace thereof, and to prevent the miſeries of Civill War amongſt your Subjects: That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we hold our ſelves bound to uſe all the meanes and power, which by the Lawes and Conſtitutions of this Kingdom we are truſted with, for defence and protection thereof, and of the Subjects from force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; We do in this our humble and loyall Petition proſtrate our ſelves at Your Majeſties feet, beſeeching your Majeſty, That you will be pleaſed to forbeare, and remove all Preparations and Actions of War, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the forces from about <hi>Hull,</hi> from <hi>Newcaſtle, Tynmouth, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and all other places; And that Your Majeſty will recall the Commiſſions of Array, which are illegall; Diſmiſſe Troops, and extraordi-Guards by you raiſed; That Your Majeſty will come neerer to your Parliament, and hearken to their faithfull Advice, and humble Petitions, which ſhall onely tend to the defence and advancement of Religion, Your owne Royall Honour and ſafety, the preſervation of our Lawes and Liberties; And we have been, and ſhall ever be carefull to prevent and puniſh al Tumults, and ſeditious Actions, Speeches, and Writings, which may give Your Majeſty juſt cauſe of diſtaſte or apprehenſion of danger. That Your Majeſty will leave delinquents to the due courſe of Juſtice; And that nothing done or ſpoken in Parliament, or by any Perſon in purſuance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Directions of both Houſes of Parliament, be queſtioned any where, but in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And we, for our Parts, ſhall be ready to lay down all thoſe preparations, which we have been forced to make for our defence. And for the Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> and the Ordinance concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> as we have in both theſe particulars, only ſought the preſervation of the Peace of the Kingdom, and the defence of the Parliament, from force and violence. So we ſhall moſt willingly leave the Town of <hi>Hull</hi> in the ſtate it was before Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> drew any forces into it, delivering Your Majeſties Magazine into Your Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing whatſoever hath been diſpoſed by us for the ſervice of the Kingdom. We ſhall be ready to ſettle the <hi>Militia</hi> by a Bill, in ſuch a way, as ſhall be Honorable and ſafe for Your Majeſty, moſt agreeable to the Duty of Parliament, and effectuall for the good of the Kingdom; That the ſtrength thereof be not imployed againſt it ſelfe; and that which ought to be for our ſecurity, applyed to our deſtruction: And that the Parliament, and thoſe who profeſſe and deſire ſtill to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion, both in this Realme and in Ireland, may not be left naked, and indefenſible, to the miſchevous deſignes, and cruell attempts of thoſe, who are the profeſt and confederate enemies thereof, in Your Majeſties Dominions, and other Neighbour Nations. To which, if Your Majeſties Courſes and Councels ſhall from henceforth concur, We doubt not but we ſhall quickly make it appeare to the World, by the moſt eminent effects of Love and Dury, That Your Majeſties perſonall ſafety, Your Royall Honour and Greatneſſe are mach deerer to us then our owne Lives and Fortunes, which we doe moſt heartily Dedicate, and ſhall moſt willingly imploy for the ſupport and maintenance thereof.</p>
